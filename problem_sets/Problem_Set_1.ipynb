    "## Problem 1: Publication Bias (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a certain STEM field, researchers are constantly testing unlikely theories. Let's say 90% of all tested theories are, in fact, false. All studies use null hypothesis significance testing with a $p$-value threshold of $0.05$ to reject the null hypothesis that the claimed theory is false. For all theories that are true, $80\\%$ reach $p \\leq 0.05$, rejecting the null hypothesis. Once the investigations are finished, papers are submitted for publication. However, publishers **exhibit publication bias**, the preference to publish novel and interesting results. As a result, studies rejecting the null hypothesis have a $100\\%$ chance of being published while only $10\\%$ of studies failing to reject the null hypothesis make it past peer review. Among theories supported by published papers, what fraction is actually true? Please explain your answer using analytic calculations."

Here, we want to test that in practice by assuming that $X$ is drawn from a uniform distribution in the range $[-0.5, +0.5]$.\n",
