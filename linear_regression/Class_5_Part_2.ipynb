    "## Problem 1: Heart Attacks in Rabbits\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will study whether the damage of heart attacks in rabbits can be mitigated by cooling down the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an [experiment](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00788947), researchers induced artery occlusion in $n=32$ rabbits and studied whether the damage in the heart is mitigated by cooling the heart prior to (group 1) or shortly after (group 2) inducing the heart attack compared to a control group (group 3) without any cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll assume the following linear model,\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\varepsilon$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $y$ (“Infarc”): size of the damaged area in grams\n",
    "- $x_1$ (“Area”): size of the area at risk in grams\n",
    "- $x_2$ (“X2”): 1 if rabbit is in group 1, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- $x_3$ (“X3”): 1 if rabbit is in group 2, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: $x_2$ and $x_3$ are categorical variables. Group 3 is the control group and has $x_2 = x_3 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Make a scatter plot of the size of the damaged area vs. the area at risk. Plot the $3$ different groups in different colors and make sure to include a legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Write down the simplified equations for the expected damaged area for the 3 groups, i.e., plug in the values for $x_2$ and $x_3$ for these groups. What is the physical interpretation of $\\beta_2$ and $\\beta_3$?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Create the design matrix of the linear equation described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Determine the best-fit predictions using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Add the best-fit predictions for each of the 3 groups onto the scatter plot from exercise (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Do the results suggest that cooling down the heart mitigates heart attack damage?\n",
    "\n",
    "(This exercise was partially inspired by https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/134/.)"
